<title>The Truth</title>
</head>

<body>
<h2>You will find no truth here, sadly, but good thing we were able to save you from that maniac!</h2>
<p>
I see that you finally found this, though, and if you have, you might have noticed that everything isn't as you expected it, do not worry, you won't get away. No one really ever gets away, they simply postpone the inevitable.</p>
<p>We already know where you live, and who you are. We know who your closest friends are, and who your family is. There is no running or fighting. There is only the way, and passing along the way.</p>
<p>We will come to get you soon, so in the mean time, go back to the site, and enjoy what little time you have left. Just remember, you did this to yourself, you had so many chances to say no, to back away. We are the ones you fear because we are the ones that you do not understand.</p>
<p>We are always there watching and waiting, always have been, always will be, but enough talk from me, it is time for you to return.</p>
<p> All we do, we do through love and fellowship.</p>
