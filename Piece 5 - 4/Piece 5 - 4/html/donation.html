 United for the Faith is a lay apostolate founded in 1968 to support, defend, and advance the efforts of the teaching Church.

Our founder, H. Lyman Stebbins, said that CUF exists “to be a little alarm clock to wake people up, and then a center around which they can rally, and act in the way befitting members of Christ’s true Church.”

<h2>How can I support CUF and its mission?</h2>
<br/>
You can support CUF in a variety of ways (click each link to learn more):
<ul>
<li>
     Pray for our work. According to our founder, H. Lyman Stebbins, “Study, prayer, fasting, and works of mercy and love toward our neighbor . . . are, necessarily and objectively, prerequisites for the effectiveness of any Christian work.”</li>

   <li>  Sign up as a monthly donor. The generous contributions of our monthly donors help CUF's daily operations to run smoothly and efficiently.</li>
   <li>  Make a pledge to our capital campaign. As CUF approaches its fortieth anniversary, we are engaged in an unprecedented initiative to expand and improve the CUF apostolate. Click here to read more.</li>
